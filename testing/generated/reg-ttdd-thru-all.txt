You now have stuff so your head doesn't get too wet. That'll make you less self-conscious going north!

>snare snows
Oh, there you go. You wait a bit, and you shuffle your feet, and somehow, your little snow dance works. You collect the snow, and you look for places to put it before it melts. You remember the heat off to the east. You hear a sizzling as the snow disappears.

>stair stows
You just know somewhere there's a stair hidden. It's a matter of finding it. And you do! That'll fix the steep drop to the west.

#testcase-run-vr-snare-snows-rule-default
Oh, there you go. You wait a bit, and you shuffle your feet, and somehow, your little snow dance works. You collect the snow, and you look for places to put it before it melts. Some trial and error leads you, where the air starts getting hotter. You hear a sizzling as the snow disappears.

#testcase-room-names-rowr-room
`Rowr Room

>tower tomb
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-tower-tomb-rule-abide-by-the-rowr-room-transform-rule
You feel a slight but long-lasting tremor. The noise seems to reduce a bit, which is nice.

#testcase-run-vr-tower-tomb-rule-default
Pop! It seems like you can see a passage briefly to a tower tomb. But it covers up. You know it's there, though. Just having more places for the noise to dissipate is a good thing.

>wower womb
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-wower-womb-rule-abide-by-the-rowr-room-transform-rule
You feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction but not emotional fulfillment. Perhaps you need to shift your focus on what to change.

#testcase-run-vr-wower-womb-rule-default
A passage opens downstairs briefly. It's too narrow, and anyway, one doesn't go back into a womb, but it's there. Just having more places for the noise to dissipate is a good thing.

>flower flume
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-flower-flume-rule-abide-by-the-rowr-room-transform-rule
The room seems to shake significantly. You stumble a bit. The room feels very unstable. The noise is almost bearable now, and perhaps you can make it completely so.

#testcase-run-vr-flower-flume-rule-default
Oh wow! Not just one flower flume but a whole bouquet of flowers! The visual pyrotechnics definitely distract you from the noise.

>plower plume
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-plower-plume-rule-abide-by-the-rowr-room-transform-rule
You feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction but not emotional fulfillment. Perhaps you need to shift your focus on what to change.

#testcase-run-vr-plower-plume-rule-default
#testcase-run-vr-plower-plume-rule-fallthrough
A giant plume rises into the air. Two, actually. One of a snow plow, the other of a plow you might see on the farm. They seem to almost try to destroy the room you are in.

>dour doom
by one point

#+testcase-room-names-rowr-room
`Bower (BOOM!)

#testcase-run-vr-dour-doom-rule-abide-by-the-rowr-room-transform-rule
Suddenly, you hear a rumbling. The top blows off the room! It's now a bower! Words escape -- simple ones, you can't quite figure them out--back to the Rare Rows. You can find more to do if you want, but you've done what you need.

#testcase-run-vr-dour-doom-rule-default
You invoke a sense of doom so dour, the rowring itself gets quieter.

>glower gloom
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-glower-gloom-rule-abide-by-the-rowr-room-transform-rule
Nothing much happens otherwise, but you feel good about going above and beyond.

#testcase-run-vr-glower-gloom-rule-default
You invoke a sense of gloom so glowery, the rowring itself gets quieter.

>fair foes
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-fair-foes-rule-default
Several warriors approach. They introduce themselves as the Fair Foes. They will be very objective, but decisive, in disposing of baddies. They will be invulnerable to any sly counterarguments.

#testcase-run-vr-bare-bows-rule-default
>bare bows
by one point
Splat! And just like that, a bunch of high quality bows, or what you assumed to be high quality, drop from some unknown direction on the ground. They don't have any ammunition to go with them, but there's got to be some, somewhere.

#testcase-run-vr-arrows-rule-default
>arrows
by one point
Now that you know to look for arrows, or to some of them, you find a bunch, and a bunch fall from the sky, too. Fortunately, none fall on your head. There's enough for a good round of fighting, and they're good ammo for the bare bows.
The fair foes nod appreciatively. They nock arrows to the bare bows, then nod. They are ready to do as you command.

>undo

#testcase-run-vr-arrows-rule-abide-by-the-to-cage-progress-rule
The fair foes pick up the arrows and study them with interest, but something is missing.

#+testcase-run-vr-arrows-rule-default
Now that you know to look for arrows, or to some of them, you find a bunch, and a bunch fall from the sky, too. Fortunately, none fall on your head. There's enough for a good round of fighting, and there's got to be something that can sling them, somewhere.

Splat! And just like that, a bunch of high quality bows, or what you assumed to be high quality, drop from some unknown direction on the ground. They don't have any ammunition to go with them, but that's okay. You already have some.

#testcase-room-names-car-cage
`Car Cage

>our age
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-our-age-rule-abide-by-the-cage-change-rule
The universe seems to lurch, or at least this small part of it. The Mar Mage shakes their fist. "Lucky! It can't happen again!"
However, it settles back. But you did something, you know that.

#testcase-run-vr-our-age-rule-default
You drag the Mar Mage out of whatever temporal oddity they are living in to face the present and also to make sure their hand isn't in the cookie jar of some ancient magic. They blush. Guilty!

>far phage
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-far-phage-rule-abide-by-the-cage-change-rule
Something has shattered. The car cage can become something more positive, you feel.
The universe seems to lurch, or at least this small part of it. The Mar Mage shakes their fist. "No! I don't believe it! You can't keep this up!"

#testcase-run-vr-far-phage-rule-default
A distant virus pops through and seeps into the Mar Mage. The strongest staff in the world won't do any good, here!

>star stage
by one point

#+testcase-room-names-car-cage
`Star Stage

#testcase-run-vr-star-stage-rule-default
On the star stage, the Mar Mage suddenly grows more powerful. You seem to have no chance...
...until in swoops a savior from distant lands. The SAAR SAGE! The battle is quick, pyrotechnic and brutal.

#testcase-run-vr-rar-rage-rule-abide-by-the-cage-change-rule

You hear a rumbling to the south. The Saar Sage seems invigorated as well. Hooray, brownie points!

#+testcase-run-vr-rar-rage-rule-abide-by-the-cage-change-rule
The star stage seems pretty relaxed, but for whatever reason, your action, incongruous as it seems, made things better. Without knowing it, you allowed everyday folk to express their discontent in new and instructive ways.

#testcase-room-names-cram-creek
`Cram Creek

>blam bleak
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-blam-bleak-rule-abide-by-the-check-sheik-rule
The Sham Sheik looks slightly irked and less intimidating. You can't administer a coup de grace yet, but he realizes you're no pushover!

#testcase-run-vr-blam-bleak-rule-default
Ooh! Cutting! You claim the Sheik is not as happy or powerful as he seems. Surprisingly, he has no good refutation.

>slam sleek
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-slam-sleek-rule-abide-by-the-check-sheik-rule
The Sham Sheik looks genuinely vexed. You're getting to him!

#testcase-run-vr-slam-sleek-rule-default
You don't just slam the Sheik. You do so with a minimum of wasted words, before he can cut you off and tell you you're boring. You repeat the barb, as if he did not understand the first time. Devastating!

>wham weak
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-wham-weak-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-vr-wham-weak-rule-abide-by-the-check-sheik-rule
Straightforward but effective. You question how much power the Sheik has, and over whom. He winces.
That does it! The Sham Sheik retreats in humiliation. The creek seems to stir a bit. You may have to call what's in there.
Oh, there's one more way to mock the now-departed Sheik if you want a bonus point, but it's not critical.

#testcase-run-vr-wham-weak-rule-default
Straightforward but effective. You question how much power the Sheik has, and over whom. He winces.

#+testcase-room-names-cram-creek
`Spam's Peak

#testcase-run-vr-clam-clique-rule-default
Hooray! With the Sham Sheik gone, the clam clique is unafraid to come out greet you. They seem to be smiling as they flap their mouths/lids. They run off south. Your work here is done.

>stair stows
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-stair-stows-rule-default
You just know somewhere there's a stair hidden. It's a matter of finding it. And you do! Then you wonder where to place it. Why, just off to the west, the land drops off. That's a good place.

>glare glows
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-glare-glows-rule-default
You look around, and you see a pair of eyes staring back at you. But instead of flinching, you look into them. You feel scared at first, but slowly, you get your courage out. It makes you feel you won't be stared down by anybody trying to pretend you are out of your league.

>crave crowned
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-crave-crowned-rule-default
Dave seems charged with motivation to be the best at something, anything!

>save sound
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-save-sound-rule-default
You catalog ways to save things soundly, as well as ways to economize on the yelling you need to do. Dave looks relieved at all this, explaining briefly that he always felt that if he wasn't yelling, he wasn't really giving 110%. He knows better now.

>pave pound
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-pave-pound-rule-default
While it's unclear whether or not you need to exhort Dave to pound the pavement, or if you have a pound full of prisoners to pay. Either way, it seems to interest him more than you'd expect.

>fave found
by one point

#+testcase-room-names-grave-ground
`Wave (Wound)

#testcase-run-vr-fave-found-rule-default
"Aha! Yes, that's what I'll focus on. My afterlife has not just purpose now but also focus!" Dave gives you a thumbs-up.
You feel a big wave in from the distance, not actually water to get you wet and all upset and so forth, but a wave of energy. Well, it sort of paused there at first, to wind up and build up kinetic energy before actually releasing itself. That just made everything powerful. Dave seems to glow as it passes through him, saying he'll see you in a bit as he runs to Rare Rows, and you feel energized, yourself.

>rave round
by one point

#testcase-run-vr-rave-round-rule-default
You feel a ripple across space. Dave must be that much happier back in Rare Rows.

#testcase-run-vr-hope-huts-rule-default
Huts are built! The Prayer Pros go over to inspect them.
The Prayer Pros look at the ruts and huts and back and forth. Yes. The new meditation places are adequate. The Prayer Pros all bow slightly to you, shaking your hand and clapping your shoulder in turn. A chorus of "Ne'er Nos" or "Ne'er Knows" (it could be either) rises. They no longer notice you. You feel deserted and trapped at first.

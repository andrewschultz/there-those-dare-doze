#testcase-run-vr-snare-snows-rule-default
Oh, there you go. You wait a bit, and you shuffle your feet, and somehow, your little snow dance works. You collect the snow, and you look for places to put it before it melts. You find it, off to the east, where the air starts getting hotter. You hear a sizzling as the snow disappears.

#testcase-run-vr-flower-flume-rule-default
Oh wow! Not just one flower flume but a whole bouquet of flowers! The visual pyrotechnics definitely distract you from the noise.

#testcase-run-vr-fair-foes-rule-default
Several warriors approach. They introduce themselves as the Fair Foes. They will be very objective, but decisive, in disposing of baddies. They will be invulnerable to any sly counterarguments.

#testcase-run-vr-arrows-rule-default
Now that you know to look for arrows, or to some of them, you find a bunch, and a bunch fall from the sky, too. Fortunately, none fall on your head. There's enough for a good round of fighting.

#testcase-run-vr-star-stage-rule-default
On the star stage, the Mar Mage suddenly grows more powerful. You seem to have no chance...
...until in swoops a savior from distant lands. The SAAR SAGE! The battle is quick, pyrotechnic and brutal.

#testcase-run-vr-slam-sleek-rule-default
You don't just slam the Sheik. You do so with a minimum of wasted words, before he can cut you off and tell you you're boring. You repeat the barb, as if he did not understand the first time. Devastating!

#testcase-run-vr-stair-stows-rule-default
You just know somewhere there's a stair hidden. It's a matter of finding it. And you do! Then you wonder where to place it. Why, just off to the west, the land drops off. That's a good place.

#testcase-run-vr-save-sound-rule-default
You catalog ways to save things soundly, as well as ways to economize on the yelling you need to do. Dave looks relieved at all this, explaining briefly that he always felt that if he wasn't yelling, he wasn't really giving 110%. He knows better now.

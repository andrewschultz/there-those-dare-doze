#testcase-run-vr-snare-snows-rule-default
Oh, there you go. You wait a bit, and you shuffle your feet, and somehow, your little snow dance works. You collect the snow, and you look for places to put it before it melts. You find it, off to the east, where the air starts getting hotter. You hear a sizzling as the snow disappears.

#testcase-run-vr-fair-foes-rule-default
Several warriors approach. They introduce themselves as the Fair Foes. They will be very objective, but decisive, in disposing of baddies. They will be invulnerable to any sly counterarguments.

#testcase-run-vr-bare-bows-rule-default
>bare bows

Splat! And just like that, a bunch of high quality bows, or what you assumed to be high quality, drop from some unknown direction on the ground. They don't have any ammunition to go with them, but there's got to be some, somewhere.

Now that you know to look for arrows, or to some of them, you find a bunch, and a bunch fall from the sky, too. Fortunately, none fall on your head. There's enough for a good round of fighting.

#testcase-run-vr-slam-sleek-rule-default
You don't just slam the Sheik. You do so with a minimum of wasted words, before he can cut you off and tell you you're boring. You repeat the barb, as if he did not understand the first time. Devastating!

#testcase-run-vr-wham-weak-rule-abide-by-the-check-sheik-rule
Straightforward but effective. You question how much power the Sheik has, and over whom. He winces.
That does it! The Sham Sheik retreats in humiliation. The creek seems to stir a bit. You may have to call what's in there.
Oh, there's one more way to mock the now-departed Sheik if you want a bonus point, but it's not critical.

You just know somewhere there's a stair hidden. It's a matter of finding it. And you do! Then you wonder where to place it. Why, just off to the west, the land drops off. That's a good place.

You catalog ways to save things soundly, as well as ways to economize on the yelling you need to do. Dave looks relieved at all this, explaining briefly that he always felt that if he wasn't yelling, he wasn't really giving 110%. He knows better now.

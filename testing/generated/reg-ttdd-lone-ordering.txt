>tower tomb
You feel a slight but long-lasting tremor. The noise seems to reduce a bit, which is nice.

>wower womb
You feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction but not emotional fulfillment. Perhaps you need to shift your focus on what to change.
[Your score and bonus points just went up by one point.]
A stun-steed zooms by, bellowing "None-need-done deed!" Have you lost focus on what's really important? Or just put in a bit of extra rigor? You decide on the second, as you could also imagine a bin-bare-min mare to insult you for finding no extra neat stuff.

>flower flume
The room seems to shake significantly. You stumble a bit. The room feels very unstable. The noise is almost bearable now, and perhaps you can make it completely so.
[Your score just went up by one point.]

>plower plume
You feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction but not emotional fulfillment. Perhaps you need to shift your focus on what to change.
[Your score and bonus points just went up by one point.]

>dour doom
Suddenly, you hear a rumbling. The top blows off the room! It's now a bower! Words escape -- simple ones, you can't quite figure them out--back to the Rare Rows. You can find more to do if you want, but you've done what you need.
[Your score just went up by one point.]

Bower (BOOM!)

>glower gloom
Nothing much happens otherwise, but you feel good about going above and beyond.

The universe seems to lurch, or at least this small part of it. The Mar Mage shakes their fist. "Lucky! It can't happen again!"
However, it settles back. But you did something, you know that.

Something has shattered. The car cage can become something more positive, you feel.

The Sham Sheik looks slightly irked and less intimidating. You can't administer a coup de grace, but he realizes you're no pushover!

That does it! The Sham Sheik retreats in humiliation. The creek seems to stir a bit. You may have to call what's in there.
Oh, there's one more way to mock the now-departed Sheik if you want a bonus point, but it's not critical.

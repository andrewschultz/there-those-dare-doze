>tower tomb
You feel a slight but long-lasting tremor. The noise seems to reduce a bit, which is nice.

>wower womb
You feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction but not emotional fulfillment. Perhaps you need to shift your focus on what to change.
[Your score and bonus points just went up by one point.]
A stun-steed zooms by, bellowing "None-need-done deed!" Have you lost focus on what's really important? Or just put in a bit of extra rigor? You decide on the second, as you could also imagine a bin-bare-min mare to insult you for finding no extra neat stuff.

>flower flume
The room seems to shake significantly. You stumble a bit. The room feels very unstable. The noise is almost bearable now, and perhaps you can make it completely so.
[Your score just went up by one point.]

>plower plume
You feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction but not emotional fulfillment. Perhaps you need to shift your focus on what to change.
[Your score and bonus points just went up by one point.]

>dour doom
Suddenly, you hear a rumbling. The top blows off the room! It's now a bower! Words escape -- simple ones, you can't quite figure them out--back to the Rare Rows. You can find more to do if you want, but you've done what you need.
[Your score just went up by one point.]

You scan the area. This will suffice most of the time, though you may wish to LL a thing that doesn't jibe with the location's rhymes.
You notice two dots in the corner.
The leet learner's display lights up and scrolls through LCD numbers which settle on the pair (0.00, -0.50.)

The Sham Sheik looks slightly irked and less intimidating. You can't administer a coup de grace yet, but he realizes you're no pushover!

You feel a big wave in from the distance, not actually water to get you wet and all upset and so forth, but a wave of energy. Well, it sort of paused there at first, to wind up and build up kinetic energy before actually releasing itself. That just made everything powerful.

Huts are built! The Prayer Pros go over to inspect them.
The Prayer Pros look at the ruts and huts and back and forth. Yes. The new meditation places are adequate. The Prayer Pros all bow slightly to you, shaking your hand and clapping your shoulder in turn. A chorus of "Ne'er Nos" or "Ne'er Knows" (it could be either) rises. They no longer notice you. You feel deserted and trapped at first.

Hmm! But what can you do with arrows? You're not a fighter, and you have no weapons.

#b-3
>bare bows
The bows and arrows would be good in a fight, but you have no accuracy. Maybe get some allies?

#f-7
>fair foes
The fair foes nod appreciatively. They nock arrows to the bare bows, then nod. They are ready to do as you command.

#f-5
>fair foes
The fair foes pick up the arrows and study them with interest, but something is missing.

It would be nice if the bare bows had some ammunition and people that could use them.

The fair foes don't seem to have anything to do. They aren't equipped for battle.

"I am the MAR MAGE!" a voice booms. You're blown back a bit.
As if the outright bluster weren't enough, you're hit with an argument as well. "You're totally invading my personal space! Sure, you think I'm the bad guy! But you haven't been fully objective! And even if you were, I'd start a righteous war, and stuff! You couldn't attack me alone!"
The Mar Mage looks tough. You realize you'll be needing the right allies, fully armed.
Start with summoning allies, then, maybe.

But the Fair Foes are not. The Mar Mage protests it's not fair, being so outnumbered! But the Fair Foes do not listen. They know the Mar Mage is outnumbered due to annoying everyone, including other evil allies. They nock their bare bows with arrows, and while the Mar Mage easily throws up a shield, the arrows do damage to it. The Mar Mage has lost their magic capabilities!
The Fair Foes salute you as they turn away. It's understood without words that if you're the good guy, you can finish the job, not necessarily killing the Mar Mage and making them a martyr (or martyr mage-ter, amirite?) But the Fair Foes also sense they are not the ones to ultimately help the Prayer Pros. And it's fair enough some work should be left to you, anyway.
Car Cage
The Mar Mage stands here defiantly! How can you adjust the Car Cage to drain their power?

Fortunately, from the Mar Mage's grumblings, it appears they haven't figured out how to recharge their spells yet. Good news! You can still tackle them.

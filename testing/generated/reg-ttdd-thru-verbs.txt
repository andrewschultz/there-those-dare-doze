Sadly, the walkthrough feelie is the only thing I had time to write up for EctoComp.

You are on a spiritual journey of sorts. You left your backpack behind in the chair-chose. You hope it's there when you get back, at any rate.
But it doesn't look like you'll need a lot here, though. It's more what you can do and think.

A stern voice booms: "SPACEY SPELL? HEY, SEE HELL!"
Better not risk it.
(Cross-promotion: why, yes, Very Vile Fairy File, Quite Queer Night Near, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey and Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming, the other four entries in the Prime Pro-Rhyme Row series, have different and equally "witty" XYZZY responses. Of course they do!)

Thanks to Ruber Eaglenest for holding EctoComp yet again and having the Grand Guignol and Petite Mort divisions, so I could submit Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming and then this as a bit of runoff. Thanks to JJ Guest for conceiving it, and to Duncan Bowsman for keeping its administration going.

You don't need any special verbs to win. The four basic cardinal directions work, and you can T NPC for small clues, maybe. The main thing is to guess what to say--you may note something about the room name and the pest.
OPTS also gives options.
META gives meta-commands that show general information.

Boring old talking won't work. You need creative and constructive ways to win an argument.

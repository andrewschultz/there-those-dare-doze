##--stable-file: this eventually says that the project is stable, and I shouldn't change the main/minimal file unless I really need to.
#--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Civil Seeming Drivel Dreaming has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.

(Cross-promotion: why, yes, Very Vile Fairy File, Quite Queer Night Near, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey and There Those Dare Doze, the other four entries in the Prime Pro-Rhyme Row series, have different and equally "witty" XYZZY responses. Of course they do!)

You're in a dream. One-on-one violence never works there.

You don't need any special verbs to win. The four basic cardinal directions work, and you can T NPC for small clues, maybe. The main thing is to guess what to say--you may note something about the room name and the pest.
OPTS also gives options.
META gives meta-commands that show general information.

You don't need any special verbs to win. The four basic cardinal directions work, and you can T NPC for small clues, maybe. The main thing is to guess what to say--you may note something about the room name and the pest.
OPTS also gives options.
META gives meta-commands that show general information.

The clam clique rapidly opens and closes their shells favorably. The clacking is as close to a laugh as you'll get. You're not running up the score, but rather, you're just making sure someone like the Sham Sheik can't cast a spell next time.

"Aha! Yes, that's what I'll focus on. My afterlife has not just purpose now but also focus!" Dave gives you a thumbs-up.
You feel a big wave in from the distance, not actually water to get you wet and all upset and so forth, but a wave of energy. Well, it sort of paused there at first, to wind up and build up kinetic energy before actually releasing itself. That just made everything powerful. Dave seems to glow as it passes through him, saying he'll see you in a bit as he runs to Rare Rows, and you feel energized, yourself.

Huts are built! The Prayer Pros go over to inspect them.
The Prayer Pros look at the ruts and huts and back and forth. Yes. The new meditation places are adequate. The Prayer Pros all bow slightly to you, shaking your hand and clapping your shoulder in turn. A chorus of "Ne'er Nos" or "Ne'er Knows" (it could be either) rises. They no longer notice you. You feel deserted and trapped at first.
